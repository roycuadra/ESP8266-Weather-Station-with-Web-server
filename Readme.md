# WeatherSense IoT Weather Station

This is my Arduino-based IoT weather station project that uses an ESP8266 WiFi module to measure and display temperature and humidity readings from a DHT11 sensor. The project also includes a Oled Display and web interface for real-time monitoring of the weather data.
